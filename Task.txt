2. The task
We want you to create an API client and example code using it to submit a sign up and enquiry to
our API.

Your code should demonstrate:
1. Creating a subscriber, including fields for:
a. Email address (mandatory)
b. First name (optional)
c. Last name (optional)
d. Date of birth (mandatory, please ensure every subscriber is at least 18 years old)
e. Marketing consent (optional, it should be possible for people to send an enquiry
without giving marketing consent)

2. Adding the subscriber to one or more of the pre-created lists (specifically the London,
Birmingham, and Edinburgh lists) based on their selection. Please only add them to the
marketing lists if they gave marketing consent.

3. Creating an enquiry linked to the subscriber, sending a user provided message to the API.

You can use any PHP framework (at Propeller we prefer Symfony), but you should provide a REST
API that would be suitable for use directly by a web browser using JavaScript.

Please provide your solution as a Git repository, ideally on a service like GitHub, GitLab, etc.

To get started, you should have been provided with the following:
1. An OpenAPI specification showing the demo CRM API
2. Documentation for the API
3. 4. The URL of an instance of the API for you to use
An access token for the API
Your instance of the API has had some subscriber lists created as well:
1. A default list
2. London
3. Birmingham
4. Edinburgh
